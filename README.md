# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

A Bingo Club is planning to introduce two new windfalls to attract more participants. Windfall gain is any type of unusually high or abundant income that is sudden and/or unexpected.The profit perspective lies in the fact that it is highly uncertain whether a person will win the game choosing to play with special tickets for windfalls that cost higher than the usual tickets.

The aim of the this simulation is to inform the decision of the club on what pay-out amount should be designated for each windfall gain.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

The pay-out amount for each windfall must be double the price of the ticket. 

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
